**Security Audit Summary & Next Steps for Botium Toys**
Following the recent security audit, Botium Toys received a score of **8/10**, indicating significant gaps in security policies, asset management, and access controls. Key findings include:
- **Lack of Formal Security Policies**: No documented policies for data protection, incident response, or acceptable use.
- **Unaccounted Assets**: IT hardware, software, and data inventories are incomplete or outdated.
- **Overexposed PII/SPII**: All employees have unnecessary access to sensitive data (Personally Identifiable Information and Sensitive PII), increasing breach risks.
### **Recommended Actions**
1. **Implement Access Controls**:
- Adopt the **principle of least privilege** (PoLP) to restrict PII/SPII access to authorized roles only.
- Enforce **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for all systems handling sensitive data.
2. **Develop Security Policies**:
- Draft **IT security**, **data classification**, and **incident response** policies aligned with frameworks like **NIST** or **ISO 27001**.
- Conduct employee training on data handling and phishing awareness.
3. **Asset Management**:
- Perform a full **inventory audit** of hardware, software, and data repositories.
- Use **asset management tools** (e.g., Jamf, SCCM) for tracking and updates.
4. **Regular Audits & Monitoring**:
- Schedule **quarterly security audits** and continuous monitoring for anomalies.
- Encrypt sensitive data **at rest and in transit**.
### **Urgency**
Addressing these gaps is critical to **prevent data breaches**, comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and protect customer trust. A follow-up audit in **3–6 months** should verify progress.
**Next Steps**:
- Assign a **security lead** to oversee remediation.
- Prioritize **PII/SPII access restructuring** immediately.
